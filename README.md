This project is an Airport menu system, allowing the user to add/remove flights, print all flgihts, and print a specific flight from the array list. 
When adding a flight, the user chooses between the cargo, passenger, or private class to add the specific details for that option. 
The flight information will also consist of destination, time, length, and payload, including the class type.
